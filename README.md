This repository is my notes/blog for [go](https://github.com/golang/go) source code

```shell script
# based on the current master branch which is 1.14
cd go
git reset --hard dd150176c3cc49da68c8179f740eadc79404d351
```

I will try to keep the contents in this repo the same style as [CPython-Internals](https://github.com/zpoint/CPython-Internals) and [Redis-Internals](https://github.com/zpoint/Redis-Internals)
